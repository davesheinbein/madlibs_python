you can be different {pluralNoun2}. The point of the game is to {verb1} every \
robot. You also need to save people. Then you can go to the next level. \
In the game Star Wars you are Luke Skywalker and you try to destroy every \
{noun1}. In a car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat every \
computerized vehicle that you are {ingVerb} against. There are a whole \
lot of other cool games. When you play some games you win {pluralNoun3} \
for certain scores. Once you are done you can cash in your tickets to get \
a big {noun2}. You can save your {pluralNoun4} for another time. When I \
went to this arcade I did not believe how much fun it would be. So far I \
have had a lot of fun every time I have been to this great arcade!"
