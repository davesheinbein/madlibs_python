things up. You just knew he was ready to go when he propped his {bodyPart} up on the \
{pieceFurniture} and gave you his {adj} bedroom eyes. After {adverb} going \
at it for {num} minutes, you both climaxed at the exact same time: {time}. But \
then you looked deep into each other's {pluralBodyParts} and knew \
exactly what the other one wanted: one more round. You put \
on {nameMusician}'s greatest hits, lit a few {food}-scented \
candles and knocked {pluralShoesBrand} for {number} more hours!"
